This is a preliminary release of only a subset of the available classes.

Only the following packages are currently included:

toxi.geom
toxi.image.util
toxi.math
toxi.util.datatypes

If you're going to use these classes for Processing projects,
first drop the "toxiclibs" folder into the "libraries" folder of your
Processing installation. You'll then need to restart Processing in order
for it to find this new library.

Source code is saved with the .jar file or follow the SVN
instructions over here:

http://code.google.com/p/toxiclibs/source

More complete JavaDocs et al in the near future!

Have fun!
