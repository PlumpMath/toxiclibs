toxi.math.waves
+ FMSawtoothWave
+ FMSquareWave
+ FMBandwidthLimitedSquareWave
+ ConstantWave
* made all wave properties public and deprecated the existing getters/setters

toxi.math.MathUtils
* deprecated fastInverseSqrt(), sqrt(), fastPow() since not faster at all anymore
* renamed fastFloor() into floor() (it's still faster than Math.floor() though)
